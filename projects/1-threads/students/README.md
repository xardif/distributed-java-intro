#Project 1 - Charity Flea Market
Sorry for being late. It took me longer that I planned to work all features out.

**HashSets** secure uniqueness of Donors, Items and Recipients names!

##Corner cases
Having one **Donor** may cause situation when **Chairman** closed market before **Donor** would've registered first item.

One **Recipient** might cause situation when he leaves before **Donors** register their **Items**, but if it's not he wons all auctions.
